## Hello World! ðŸŒŽ
## ðŸ’¬ About me
I am a full-stack developer. I enjoy taking an abstract notion of what can be done, figuring out how to formulaically do that, and ultimately packing that code into a user-friendly application. I am eager to connect with anyone on a similar journey and anyone with opportunities in tech.

I started my professional journey the traditional way: at college. After earning an Associates I took some time off so I would not have to take out a loan to earn a Bachelor's. It became clear to me that 'learning to code' was my best path forward. In high school I was on the Mock Trial team, and I enjoyed spending long hours breaking down case law, so highly logical analysis and problem solving appealed to me, and the sheer amount of opportunity and innovation going on in the tech sector made it clear to me that I ought to join.

I chose LearningFuze as my gateway to full stack development. The hottest crucible forges the best steel, and LF's curriculum is rigorous, going over not just the technical requirements, but the tools working programmers use to program faster and smarter (like Tailwind and Typescript). I enjoy the thoroughness with which we have explored the architecture behind our code, from big O notation to serverless frameworks, the depth to which we learn each topic, and the way instructors pushed us to learn new things like Three.js when it could augment our projects. Additionally, the collaborative aspect of being a programmer is one of the emphases at LF, and it's always a joy not just to move forward, but to move forward together. Right now I am putting my nose to the grindstone, sharpening my skills every day, and I know you all will be excited by the results.
