## Hello World! ðŸŒŽ
## ðŸ’¬ About me
California-based full stack software engineer skilled in React, PostgreSQL, Node.js, and Express.js. One of my favorite hobbies is baking, so I built a React-based application for chefs and home cooks to quickly access a digital database of their recipes. To bring this application to life, I planned with Figma, coded with VScode, stored my work via Git on Github, and used AWS for hosting. My biggest takeaway in using React was just how convenient it is to use components that update with useEffects rather than vanilla JavaScript and HTML, which require many additional manual updates.

I love creating, I find it so fulfilling that it surprises me that everyone does not give it a try. I love that I can write out the logic of a website and see that made manifest. I love knowing I can make user experience just a little bit more joyful by enhancing CSS with smooth transitions and making elements pop by adding box shadows. I love most of all when the images in my head take on form and function, and the satisfaction of hard work resulting in a job well done.
